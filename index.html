			<h3>About the Film</h3>
				<span style="float:left;font-size:44px;line-height:35px;padding-top:3px; padding-right:3px;font-family: gill sans;">D</span>
				<p>eadset is a New Zealand Short film.  It was made in November 2013 by Filmmaker Aidan Otene Dickens, who wrote, directed and prodcued it.  The film is about two characters that are trying to escape from their lives and what happenes when they meet.  The themes of the film are escape and wish fulfillment, with the idea being that escape isn't always the answer.  Deadset was made for the 2014 Tropfest Film competition, but due to it's adult themed content it was unable to be screeened.  It has since been entered in over 40 film festivals worldwide, and has recently won it's first award, an Award of Merit from the Indie Fest Film Festival in California, USA.</p>

		<H3>Synopsis</H3>
				<span style="float:left;font-size:44px;line-height:35px;padding-top:3px; padding-right:3px;font-family: gill sans;">M</span>
				<p>arcus is driving along a country road when he sees Daria hitchhiking and picks her up. Through conversation we learn that they are both running away from something; Marcus from his controlling mother and Daria from her dark past as a prostitute. Daria is a Wiccan and is trying to find an ancient, mystical door that will open for the right person and grant them a single wish, but when it comes time for her to say goodbye to Marcus it becomes clear that maybe they share a common future as well.
				Daria leaves Marcus and enters a tunnel where the door is hidden. Using her magic she draws a door on the wall and begins a blood ritual that will open it; but it doesn't work. Was it all in her mind, or is there another chance to have her wish granted and escape the life she's been running from? That's when Marcus enters the tunnels and comes looking for her, to see if she needs help and certain they are kindred spirits. Emotionally drained and at the end of the rope, Daria does something unexpected, and that's where things start to go wrong.</P>
